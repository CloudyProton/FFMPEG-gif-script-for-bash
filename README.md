# FFMPEG-gif-script-for-bash

* Install ffmpeg (you might need to install a package manager, such as brew for OS X).
* Clone the repo
* Usage: ./gifenc [input] [output] [horizontal resolution for output] [fps]
* "./gifenc input.mov output.gif 720 10" will output 720p wide 10fps gif from the movie you gave it. (chmod +x gifenc.sh` might be needed to run beforehand)
